# Social-Distance-Detector
Social Distancing is one such terminology that has gained popularity over the past few months, thanks to COVID-19. People are forced to maintain a sufficient amount of distance between each other to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. Amidst this crisis, we decided to build a simple Social Distancing Detector that could monitor the practice of social distancing in a crowd. This project uses Deep Learning based YOLOv3 Pre trained model for object Detection, OpenCV python library for image processing and Centroid Tracking Algorithm For object tracking. The distance between people can be estimated and any noncompliant pair of people in the display will be indicated with a red frame and red line. The proposed method was validated on a pre-recorded video of pedestrians walking on the street. The result shows that the proposed method is able to determine the social distancing measures between multiple people in the video.
